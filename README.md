# Boosting Algorithms: Adaboost, XGBoost, GradientBoost
This repository demonstrates the implementation of three popular boosting algorithms used in machine learning for regression tasks: Adaboost, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting. These algorithms are widely applied to improve the performance of weak learners by combining them into a strong learner, especially for predicting continuous values.

### Overview
- Adaboost: Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) is an ensemble learning method that works by combining multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to form a strong model. The algorithm focuses on training subsequent models on the mistakes of previous models.

- Gradient Boosting: Gradient Boosting is a boosting algorithm that builds trees sequentially, each tree trying to correct the errors of the previous one. It minimizes a loss function by adding new models that predict the residuals (errors) of prior models.

- XGBoost: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an optimized and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It incorporates advanced techniques to prevent overfitting, handle missing values, and work efficiently with large datasets. XGBoost is known for its speed and performance.

### Contents
1. Adaboost:
- Implementation using sklearn for regression tasks.

2. Gradient Boosting:
- Implementation using sklearn's GradientBoostingRegressor for regression tasks.

3. XGBoost:
- Implementation using xgboost library for regression tasks.

### Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to install the following libraries:

- scikit-learn for Adaboost and GradientBoostingRegressor.
- xgboost for XGBoost implementation.
- numpy and pandas for data manipulation.
- matplotlib for visualization (optional).

You can install these dependencies using pip:

    pip install scikit-learn xgboost numpy pandas matplotlib

# Usage
  1. Adaboost:

  - Load your dataset and preprocess it.
  - Use the AdaBoostRegressor from sklearn to fit the model.
  - Evaluate performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

  Example:
  
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostRegressor
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    # Load data
    X, y = load_data()  # Replace with your dataset
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Initialize AdaBoost regressor with Decision Tree as base learner
    model = AdaBoostRegressor(base_estimator=DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3), n_estimators=50)

    # Train model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

  2. Gradient Boosting:

     - Use GradientBoostingRegressor from sklearn for regression tasks.
    
  Example:
  
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    # Load data
    X, y = load_data()  # Replace with your dataset
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Initialize Gradient Boosting regressor
    model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)

    # Train model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

  3. XGBoost:

   - Use XGBRegressor from the xgboost library.

  Example:

    import xgboost as xgb
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

    # Load data
    X, y = load_data()  # Replace with your dataset
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

    # Initialize XGBoost regressor
    model = xgb.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)

    # Train model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

## Evaluation Metrics

For regression tasks, common evaluation metrics include:

  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
  - R-squared (RÂ²): Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
